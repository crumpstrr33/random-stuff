# Random Stuff
These are just random bits of code based on ideas and random curiosity. Mostly done for learning purposeful and such. They are each described below.

## bouncing.py
A program that uses the tkinter module to simulate bouncing squares and collision detection and response using conservation of energy and momentum.
#### TODO
Will add accurate collision
Maybe a rotational aspect in the future

## file_renaming.py
Given a directory, this code will give random names to files with a type contained in the _ftype_ keyword based on what is passed to the other keywords as described in the code triple-quote comments.
#### TODO
Ability to sepcific the exact order you want the characters (e.g. lowercase, then uppercase, then number, then lowercase, etc.)
Add a character set for allowable special characters

## fouriest.py
<img src="http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20130201.gif" align="right" width="306" height="335" />

This code was inspired by this comic from the webcomic Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal which I highly recommend checking out. The direct link to the comic is found in the code.

Given a number in base 10, the code will find the "fouriest" base(s) (since multiple bases could have the same number of fours) and print them out along with their corresponding numbers. Although only 62 digits are used (lowercase, uppercase and 0-9), it can find numbers above base 62 given that the number does not use a digit 62. If this is the case, the number isn't found.
#### TODO
Allow the input of any base number
Allow the code to find numbers above base 62 with a digit above 62 if it is indeed the fouriest

## matrix_functions.py
Various functions for an NxN matrix
#### TODO
Add cooler functions
